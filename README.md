Project Title: Prediction of Disease Outbreaks Using Machine Learning

Project Description:

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of various diseases, including Heart Disease, Diabetes, and Parkinson's Disease, using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to develop an intelligent system that can assist in early disease detection based on patient data, reducing diagnosis time and improving healthcare outcomes.

Key Features:

Data Collection & Preprocessing: Uses datasets containing medical parameters such as blood pressure, glucose levels, heart rate, and neurological symptoms.

Machine Learning Models:Implements classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks for accurate predictions.

Feature Engineering: Identifies key biomarkers and risk factors to enhance model accuracy.

User Interface: Develops a simple web application (using Flask/Django) where users can input their health data and get predictions.

Visualization & Insights: Provides graphical insights into risk factors and disease probability.

Technologies Used:

Programming Languages: Python
Libraries & Frameworks: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, Matplotlib, Flask/Django
Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL (for storing patient data)
Deployment: Cloud-based or local deployment using Docker/AWS

Expected Outcome:

A reliable disease prediction system that can help healthcare professionals and individuals in early detection and preventive care.
